//! Editor-wide commands: the one place a keystroke becomes an intent.
//!
//! Three surfaces can read a key, and they are not peers:
//!
//! | Surface | Owns | Where |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | A text buffer | characters, caret keys, its own Escape | [`crate::inspector`] for a field or a name, `canvas` for an object's text |
//! | A panel | its own navigation over its own rows | [`crate::layers`] |
//! | This module | everything the whole editor answers to | [`crate::shell`] |
//!
//! So this file resolves keys into [`Command`]s and knows nothing about how one
//! is carried out: it is a pure function of the key, the modifiers, and
//! [`Scope`]. The shell is the only caller that executes the result, which is
//! why the answer to "which surface owns this key" has exactly one answer.
//!
//! Two rules the corpus in `docs/research/interaction/keyboard.md` settled, and
//! which the shape of this module is built around:
//!
//! 1. **A text buffer is above the editor.** Typing `f` into a layer name must
//!    not also switch to the frame tool, so [`Scope::TextEditing`] removes the
//!    commands that would move or replace objects.
//! 2. **Modifiers are context, not decoration.** `⌘D` duplicates in three
//!    products and deselects in the fourth; the arrow keys nudge a selection and
//!    pan the view with nothing selected. A keymap cannot express either, which
//!    is why this is a function with a scope argument and not a table of
//!    strings.
//!
//! Escape is deliberately *not* in the table. It does one job — leave the most
//! recent thing you entered — and it does it by walking a ladder, so it lives
//! in [`EscapeState`] instead and the shell asks that ladder first.
