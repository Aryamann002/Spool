//! The Inspector: the surface that shows what is selected and asks for changes
//! to it.
//!
//! # What this module owns
//!
//! A *surface*, not a store. Three things live here:
//!
//! 1. The vocabulary every row is built from — [`Value`], [`Availability`],
//!    [`NumberSpec`], [`Property`], [`Paint`], [`Focus`].
//! 2. The interaction grammars — [`NumberEdit`] for typing and [`Scrub`] for
//!    dragging — as pure functions of what happened, so they can be pinned down
//!    in tests without a window.
//! 3. The widgets that draw them, and the composition that decides which rows
//!    belong to which selection.
//!
//! # What this module must never own
//!
//! Document state, and any way to change it. Every control here ends in
//! [`Inspector::commit_number`] or [`Inspector::commit_paint`], which hand a
//! request to the canvas — the one place that owns geometry, appearance and the
//! history boundary. That boundary is why adding rotation, constraints,
//! alignment or auto-layout is a new [`Property`] and a new row rather than an
//! edit to `canvas.rs` or to a gesture handler:
//!
//! - one typed value is one semantic operation, because it is one
//!   `set_object_geometry` or one `set_selected_style`;
//! - one drag is one semantic operation, because [`Scrub`] holds an unrecorded
//!   gesture and the canvas records it when the drag ends — this module never
//!   sees the individual moves, so it cannot record one per frame;
//! - a drag that ends where it started records nothing, and Escape abandons a
//!   gesture rather than committing it, because both are already decisions the
//!   canvas makes.
//!
//! # The three states of a property
//!
//! A property of a *selection* is never just a value. It is one of three
//! things — set, unset, or mixed — and all three are first class.
//! [`Value::across`] folds a selection's readings into exactly one of them, so
//! `Mixed` can never be produced by a row that forgot to check, and can never
//! be a number the user did not choose and could not act on.
//!
//! The three states are not equally editable, and the difference is the point:
//! paint can be set across a mixed selection because "make these all this
//! colour" is one operation, while geometry cannot be, because a box has one
//! position and a mixed selection has no agreed one to show. That asymmetry
//! lives in [`Inspector::availability`], not in each row.
